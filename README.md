# ExpressTS REST API Boilerplate

A lightweight and flexible boilerplate for building JSON-based REST APIs, designed to serve as a foundation for common backend applications such as:
- üè∑Ô∏è White-label platforms
- üìä Admin dashboards and analytics tools
- üì∞ Headless CMS implementations
- üóÉÔ∏è Data management systems with full CRUD support

This boilerplate is built with extensibility in mind, and is ready to integrate with modern backend technologies like WebSockets, message brokers, third-party APIs, and more. Use it as a starting point for scalable and modular backend architectures.

## Core Features
|Name|Description|
|--|--|
|**Structured Codebase**|Clear separation of concerns using Model-View-Controller architecture.|
|**JWT Authentication**|Secure and token-based authentication for APIs.|
|**Built-in Middleware**|Authentication, request validation, and consistent response formatting.|
|**Utility Toolkit**|Includes helpers for:<br>- Cryptography<br>- JWT handling<br>- Logging<br>- Resource serialization<br>- String manipulation<br>- Filesystem operations|
|**Module Aliases**|Simplified imports using `@` alias.|
|**Type Safety**|Comes with pre-defined types.|
|**ORM and DB Management**|`Objection.js` as Object Relational Mapper, and `Knex.js` as query builder, database migration, and seeder.|

## Tech Stack
|Category|Technology|

## API Specification
See the full [API Specification](docs/api.md) for details.

## Notes
Since this boilerplate uses JWT with a combination of short and long-lived token expiration,
the invalidation of user session is NOT as immediate as a traditional session-based authentication.
For a specific use case where immediate invalidation of user session is the top-priority,
please use the latter approach for authentication.

This boilerplate also enforces multi factor authentication using email as its sole factor.
Developers can disable this feature and use the default authentication flow by changing the value
of `ENABLE_EMAIL_VERIFICATION` to `false` on the environment variable.
Any other support (other than OAuth2.0), will require a small patch to the database schema.
